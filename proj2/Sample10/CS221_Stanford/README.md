# CS221_Stanford
Introduction to AI course at Stanford - Fall 2011.

1) Search 
Implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

2) Multi-Agent Search 
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implemented multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

3) Reinforcement Learning 
Implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms.

4) Ghostbusters 
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Implemented exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

5) Contest: Pacman Capture the Flag 
Created strategies for a team of two agents to play a multi-player capture-the-flag variant of Pacman.
