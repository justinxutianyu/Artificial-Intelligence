# Adversarial-Search-Pacman

Using adversarial search techniques viz:

1) Minimax Algorithm
2) Alpha-Beta Pruning

to solve classis pacman game. We tested different types of parameters like 

a) Distance from the ghost
b) Number of capsules left
c) Distance from food etc.

to see the effects of the algorithms at different complexities of the board configuartion. We used the infrastructure provided by UC Berkley Pacman game to develop our algorithms.
