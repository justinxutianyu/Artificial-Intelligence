The projects in the class were about Pacman and how to make it an autonomous agent, capable of eating food, chasing ghosts and adapting to every situation automatically.

The code is in general clean but it lacks comments that explain what is going on. I will add them shortly.
The contest code is quite messy but a bit more commented, and there are several suboptimal solutions to pick from (ending with team.py).
