MIndiGolog workshop (II)
-------------------

The cook, the thief, the programmer and the situation calculus (continued)


Task 1:

Based on the code from workshop (I):

(i) Try increasing parallelism by making salad, cake and the tomato
omellette in parallel (or alternatively make two of the same dish).

Task 2:

(i) Try introducing more chefs.

(ii) Try limiting the number of ingredients/utensils or requiring more
ingredients for baking and see what happens.

For example

- reduce number of eggs available (assume somebody has stolen some) or
require more eggs, such as include an egg in making cake or more eggs
for omelette.

- try stealing (removing) one of the knives or cutting boards used for
chopping ingredients.

- Experiment by trying to non-deterministically select "pi" , and
non-deterministically "ensureHas"  board and knife in parallel: does
this work? if so why? if not, why not?
